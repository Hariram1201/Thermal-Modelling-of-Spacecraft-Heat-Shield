# Thermal-Modelling-of-Spacecraft-Heat-Shield
MATLAB project simulating 1D &amp; 2D heat transfer in spacecraft heat shield tiles during re-entry. Implements multiple numerical methods with Neumann boundaries, optimizes discretisation, calculates minimum safe tile thickness, and includes GUIs for heat flow and damage visualisation.
